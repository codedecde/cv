    Work on different NLP components for an automated scheduling assistant, which schedules meetings via email by understanding intent, extracting different meeting parameters, balloting participants and understanding different aspects associated with scheduling meetings. Developed models around intent classification, entity extraction, time entity understanding and resolution. Also built models around negation scope detection for identifying times to avoid while scheduling. Concurrently, worked on scoping relevant parts of emails to improve performance of downstream tasks. The resulting impact was instrumental in taking automation levels from $<$ 20\% to $>$ 90\%. Finally, also worked on organizing learning sessions, reading groups and workshops to help colleagues with NLP fundamentals.
